# CROWD MIC: “POCKET MIC”
## ABOUT THE APP-Problem & Soln.: 
Pocket Mic is the application that turns the audience’s phones into wireless microphones for live 
events. No more running microphones around the room or putting mics on stands in the isles. 
Attendees talk from their seats are heard. Besides the potential financial savings, the audience 
interaction is way better. Everyone’s mobile carries a microphone and hence by enabling it, one can 
speak into their mobile and can be heard over the hall through speakers.
## Equipment’s / Tech Required:
A smartphone. Sound System. Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Network and the Pocket Mic’s App installed in their 
devices.
#### How does it works? :
The app consists of 2 parts- (i) Receiver/Host (ii) Broadcaster/Audience. Both of them will be 
connected over the same network which can be either Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. We can use Wi-Fi Direct 
(/Peer2Peer): It is a Wi-Fi standard enabling devices to easily connect with each other without 
requiring a wireless access point. Or can go for the traditional Bluetooth.
### (i) Receiver/Host :
Receiver will guide the audience to download the app in their smartphone. And will tell 
them to join his hosted event. Once the audience will start joining the event, their IP will 
be fetched by the app and will be displayed in the <List View> at their seat number’s 
index inside the receiver’s application. Thus, a list will be created consisting of all the 
audience members. Their mic can be turned on/off by the receiver through his app as 
per the needs.
### (ii) Broadcaster/Audience:
Audience will install the app and will do the initial sign up by providing their Name and 
seat number. Next up they will select the hosted event. Whenever, they want to speak 
they can tap the Talk <Button> to inform the Receiver so as to turn their mic on.
Henceforth, the receiver will turn his mic on and they can converse. Seat Number will 
help in locating the person’s position in the hall and will remove the same name clash.
Further, we can merge both the applications into a single app where one can be the Receiver just by
selecting the admin panel and can host the events. And the audience can join by selecting the 
“audience” panel.
